# ðŸ’¬ Sentiment Analysis for Yelp Customer Reviews

## Project Overview
This project builds a neural network to analyze Yelp customer reviews and predict whether they are positive or negative. By training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify sentiment, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer emotions. These insights allow companies to address customer concerns, refine their products or services, and improve marketing strategies to better meet customer needs and increase satisfaction.
**Research Question:** Can a neural network predict sentiment based on Yelp customer reviews?

## Methodology
- Sentiment analysis was performed using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to classify customer reviews as positive or negative.
- The LSTM model was trained on preprocessed text data to identify sentiment patterns.

## Key Findings
- The LSTM model classifies Yelp reviews sentiment with 77% accuracy.
- The model captures nuanced sentiment patterns, improving the ability to respond to customer needs in real-time and adjust business practices accordingly.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pytorch
- TensorFlow
- Keras
